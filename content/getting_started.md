###  Okay, lets see how this works. 

I like this theme a lot and hugo seems to be an easy way to create a website. 
The only thing that confuses me is how to make **different** sites that uses other themes. 
There must be a _nice_ way to do it. 

Currently, I can see a "workaround". 
I can basically put some if statements in the ```single.html``` where I specify a concrete behavior for a page _x_.
That's weird.

Still don't know how to center images.
